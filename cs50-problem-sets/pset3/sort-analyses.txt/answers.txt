sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because it is suitable for algorithms with O(n²) in the worst case and Ω(n) in the best case, which may cause time-related confusion

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because it is faster than the other algorithms.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Because it is suitable for algorithms with O(n²) in the worst case and Ω(n²) in the best case which are equal.
