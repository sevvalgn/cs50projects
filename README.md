# CS50 Problem Sets – C Programming

This repository contains my solutions to selected problem sets from Harvard University's CS50 course.  
The projects focus on building strong foundations in C programming, problem solving, and algorithmic thinking.

The implementations are kept simple and readable, reflecting a learning-oriented approach rather than production-level optimization.

---

## Problem Set 1 – C Basics

This section includes introductory programs written in C to practice:
- Basic input and output
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Simple arithmetic operations

These problems helped me understand how programs interact with user input and how basic logic is structured in C.

## Problem Set 2 – Arrays and Strings

This problem set focuses on:
- Working with arrays and strings
- Looping through data structures
- ASCII values and character manipulation
- Basic encryption and text processing logic

Through these exercises, I improved my understanding of memory layout and string handling in C.

## Problem Set 3 – Algorithms

This section introduces fundamental algorithmic concepts such as:
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting logic
- Comparing efficiency of different approaches

The problems emphasize logical thinking and step-by-step problem decomposition rather than advanced optimizations.

## Problem Set 4 – Memory and Image Processing

This problem set focuses on:
- Pointers and memory management
- Working with files
- Manipulating data at a lower level
- Understanding how memory is accessed and modified

These exercises strengthened my understanding of how programs work closer to the hardware level.
