# CS50 Problem Sets (1–4)

This repository documents my progress through the early problem sets of Harvard University’s CS50 course.

It includes only the **submitted solutions** for Problem Sets 1–4, organized by problem set.  
Introductory exercises, experiments, and provided starter files are intentionally excluded.

## Repository Layout
- Each folder represents one problem set.
- Files contain only my own work or required written submissions.
- All programs are written in C.

## Purpose
This repository is maintained for academic review and university applications, to demonstrate foundational programming skills and structured problem-solving.
